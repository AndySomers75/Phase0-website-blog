            <li>
                <h3>What went well? Key Learning</h3>
                <p>I think the final outcome was a positive considering the challenge I encountered trying to format all
                    the different elements together. Gaining a basic understanding of html and CSS has allowed me to build
                    on and expand my knowledge. I can see now how important it is to plan the html structure and to do a layout design prior 
                    to starting so that a complete overhaul is not needed. In the end I was able to complete my external CSS file by gaining a better knowledge
                    of using (div) elements and how to properly code (elements,id's, class) in the CSS external file and how it communicates to html.

                <h3>What could have been improved?</h3>
                <p>Honestly it was difficult because I wanted to complete a website that had functionality and looked good.
                    Unfortunately not having fully grasped CSS before starting and still working on the last section of the 
                    Html learning labs restricted my ability to produce a professional looking site. 
                    Gaining a better understanding of CSS will be the most advantagous outcome for me because the amount of 
                    time I spent adjusting the CSS parameters I could of included additional links and functions such as a 
                    photo library with "nav" elements.
                    Improving on formatting, positioning using (sticky,fixed,relative and absolute) is definately needed.
                                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>The key take aways.</h3>
                <p>I am really satisfied of the outcome and the dedication it took me to overcome all the challenge. My ability to 
                    research unknown functions or fix errors has been a enourmous. The biggest take away  will be to complete a better
                    structual plan of the website content and then consider what features or functions are required. In my case I had to modify
                    my plan simply because I wasn't able to get the Css code to work. The background I initially wanted was a programming
                    screen. 
                    I am going to continue to do small (labs) to reinforce my knowledge and understanding of html and CSS.
